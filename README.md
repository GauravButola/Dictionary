Run the application
=
	- Clone the get repo `git clone https://github.com/GauravButola/Dictionary.git`
	- Copy the database file to the default LocalStorage path; this shouldn't have been required but untill I figure out how to change it to a custom path, this must be done manually. `cp OfflineStorage/Databases/* ~/.local/share/Nokia/QtQmlViewer/QML/OfflineStorage/Databases/`
	- `cd Dictionary`
	- `qmlscene Dictionary.qml`
